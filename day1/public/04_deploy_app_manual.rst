Manually deploy a simple two-tier application
=============================================

This workshop is not about manipulating OpenStack itself but will guide you through the deployment
of a two-tier application using pre-made scripts by installing WordPress on one vm and MariaDB on
the other.

WordPress is the most famous Content Management System, written in PHP. It needs a webserver, which
you will install on the first VM, and a database server (MariaDB here), which you will install on
the second server.

Pre-requisites
--------------

You need to have complete the :doc:`previous course <03_manage_networks_and_ports>` and have
**two** instances active with a private network. The two instances should have the following
features:

* ``vm01`` has a private port attached with a fixed IP address of ``10.0.0.100``
* ``vm02`` has a private port attached with a fixed IP address of ``10.0.0.101``

Deploy the software manually
----------------------------

You'll start with the database server on ``vm02``.

Install MariaDB on ``vm02``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will be asked for ``vm01``'s public IP address so first look it up:

.. code:: shell

    openstack server show -f value -c addresses vm01

Connect to the ``vm02`` instance and run the following command:

.. code:: shell

    # With the ip of vm02
    ssh debian@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

    # Download the prepared installation script
    debian@vm02:~$ wget https://{WORKSHOP_SERVER}/_static/104_mariadb.sh

    # Run it as root
    debian@vm02:~$ sudo bash 104_mariadb.sh

Install WordPress on ``vm01``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connect to the ``vm01`` instance and run the following command:

.. code:: shell

    # With the ip of vm01
    ssh debian@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

    # Download the prepared installation script
    debian@vm01:~$ wget https://{WORKSHOP_SERVER}/_static/104_wordpress.sh

    # Run it as root
    debian@vm01:~$ sudo bash 104_wordpress.sh

Now you can browse to the given URL to see the result of the installation.

This small course is only here to show you the result of a manual deployment. Let's head to the
:doc:`next course <05_security>` to automate things a bit more.
