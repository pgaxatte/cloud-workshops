[Bonus] Re-deploy the two-tier application using metadata
=========================================================

This workshop will guide you through the deployment of WordPress + MariaDB using
userdata supplied on boot.

`cloud-init <https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io>`__ is a daemon running on all
instances by default. It enables you to perform some tasks right after boot in
order to automate parts of your deployment.

cloud-init can, among many other functionalities, run a script to install the
software you installed earlier manually.

In order to know what to do, cloud-init needs some instructions which you pass
to the instance in the form of a `cloud-config YAML file
<https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html>`__ and this
metadata will be read by cloud-init's daemon.

Delete previous instances
-------------------------

Since you can only use cloud-init on boot, you need to start over. Please
complete the following tasks:

.. admonition:: Task 1

    Delete the two instances ``vm01`` and ``vm02``

.. admonition:: Task 2

    Delete the two volumes ``volume01`` and ``volume02``

.. note::

    Keep the private ports you will need them

Create public ports
-------------------

You will need to know in advance the IP address of the WordPress instance in
order to configure WordPress properly. The best way to do that is to first
create public ports to reserve some public IP addresses and then attach them to
the instances.

.. note::

    It is a best practice to create ports for instances which you intend to use
    with a DNS record.

First, look up the public network's ID:

.. code:: shell

    openstack network show -c id -f value Ext-Net

Create the two public ports for your instances:

.. code:: shell

    openstack port create --network 581fad02-... pub01
    openstack port create --network 581fad02-... pub02

.. note::

    Notice how you don't supply a ``--fixed-ip`` option as earlier with private
    ports?

    This is because you can't choose an IP address on the public
    network, it is given to you by the infrastructure.

Deploy the software on boot
---------------------------

In order to tell cloud-init what to do, you need to write the userdata that
will run the scripts.

Write the user-data files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The two instances will have different commands to run on boot so you need to
create two separate user-data files.

    To be continued...
