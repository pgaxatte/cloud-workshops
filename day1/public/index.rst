Public Cloud
============


The goal of this first workshop on Public Cloud is to guide you towards a
simple deployment of two instances using the command-line. These two instances
will be connected to the internet and between them via a private network. You
will also learn how to use volumes and manage the security by restricting the
access to your instances.
